[Verse 1]
A blind man lost, in the streets
A pattern here, I need to see
Keep returning keep trying to leave
Got a bad feeling that I need to feel
Black dog runs at my side
Down a road, no end in sight
The city sleeps but in my mind
Got a knot that won't unwind

[Chorus]
Tonight is the night that we run
The hunter becomes what he hunts
The escape and the chase is now one
Run, run
Tonight is the night that we run
The hunter becomes what he hunts
The escape and the chase is now one
Run, run
[Verse 2]
In concrete canyons squinting neon eyes
Black dog besidе me, like shadow needing light
Stalk the backstreets, nеver at ease
Locked in a chaze that'll never cease
A bloody moon, portending doom
Another cruel day is coming soon
Have to end this but it's just begun
A ﬁnal charge, with the rising sun

[Hook]
Black dog in my head
Guiding me to the end
Black dog in my head
Guiding me to the end
Black dog in my head
Guiding me to the end
Black dog in my head

[Verse 3]
In concrete canyons squinting neon eyes
Black dog beside me, like shadow needing light
Stalk the backstreets, never at ease
Locked in a chaze that'll never cease
A bloody moon, portending doom
Another cruel day, coming soon
Have to end this but it's just begun
A ﬁnal charge, with the rising sun
