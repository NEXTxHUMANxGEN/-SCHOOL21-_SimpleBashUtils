[Intro]
In our willingness to be bought
And in a hunger, hunger to buy
Hear the wish to be oppressed
To atleast get to be oppresed in style

[Verse 1]
Freedom is slavery
Your content sold
Your liquid dorsal
So proﬁtable
Pay for pastime
Pay to unwind
Pay to be born
Pay to die
[Chrous]
So-so savage the new machine
Geared to hunt down your privacy
So-so savage the new machine
Kill it all for a like supreme
So-so savage the new machine
Geared to hunt down your privacy
So-so savage the new machine
Kill it all for a like supreme

[Bridge]
Here we are now so entertained
We aim for stupid means we’re going insane

[Verse 2]
Conﬂict is order
There’s war in peace
Adjust the language
To what they believe
Friction is power
The distance is
From not knowing
To knowing this

[Chrous]
So-so savage the new machine
Geared to hunt down your privacy
So-so savage the new machine
Kill it all for a like supreme
So-so savage the new machine
Geared to hunt down your dignity
So-so savage the new machine
Kill it all for a like supreme
A like supreme
